It took more time to edit than I expected so I just re-editted the files of Neural Network (the baysian, SARIMAX need a lot of anaconda configuration that made me gave up at QUT lab) 
So you can see that each jupyter file I have completed with different methods. And 1 data set is removed because it was too large for github platform (170mb)
