- Reverse Latent Autoregressive Model - HMM (target/hidden states -> observed states %)
- Not enough dataset for the moment: 
	+ 1 Aussie Dataset => national population of aussie (birthrate - deaththrate)
	+ 1 Aussie Hospital Admission => identify a more precise of obsersed states => patient records in Aussie hospital (influenza, psneumia, ...)
-> Run diff models, compare similarities of each model's result to decide superior one
Should not minimize the model outcome 
- ABS(deathrate - 2019) => 2020 => difference can bring out the influence of covid => identify the natural state of diseases 

Consider under-reported cases => deathtoll (Hard to relate deathtoll to covid under-reporting cases since peer-reviewed parameters are not specfically suitable for respecitve treatment, 

Apply the model on (supposed Dengue/) to see the conf_int() before implementing to covid cases (suggested for a more well-reported viral disease)- 

- Diagrams

- Aim to generate estimations and allow for improvement
- Improve existing Model => Compare SIR infection in Australia from seasonal periods (autogressive non-stationary (should be ARMA?) <= specified later (cant be ARMI)
